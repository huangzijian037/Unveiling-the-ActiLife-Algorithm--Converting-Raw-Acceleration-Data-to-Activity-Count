# Unveiling-the-ActiLife-Algorithm--Converting-Raw-Acceleration-Data-to-Activity-Count
Conference paper of wireless health 2015

The paper "Unveilling the ActiLife Algorithm: Converting Raw Acceleration Data to Activity Count" is going to be submitted to Wireless Health 2015.
The open source codes and data are put in Github for scholars to use and to improve the transparency in th ActiLife software. 

"Paper" folder: Includes the draft of the paper
"Step1-Identify filter shape" folder: it includes all artificial data, and activity counts from the ActiLife and Matlab code to plot the filter shape.
"Step2-Identify amplitude threshold" folder: it includes all artificial data, and activity counts from the ActiLife and Matlab code to plot the amplitude threshold.
"Step3-Identify weighting factor" folder: It includes real GT3X data and activity counts from the ActiLife. Unfortunately we cann't upload the raw data to Github because it exceeds the limit size of the data.
However, the users are able to create the raw acceleration data (in .csv) from the ActiLife by inputing the GT3X file.
"Step4-Error analysis" folder: It includes ten 20-day GT3X datasets and its corresponding activity counts from the ActiLife. The users are able to get the raw
acceleration data from the ActiLife by inputing the GT3X files. This folder also includes the Matlab codes to plot the error analysis results presented in the paper.
